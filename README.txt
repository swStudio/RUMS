Buddies, remember to click this link when you start your work, https://github.com/swStudio/RUMS.
Below are some commands that we use ofen:
1. Open the disk or any file directory you wanna pull or clone the project on the github, take an example, open disk e, you can use command cd e: to do that.
2. If you lose the file of our repository, you can clone it anyway: git clone git@github.com:swStudio/RUMS.git RUMS
3. When you finish the task in the wiki, then commit and leave your comments, telling that what you have done and the difficuties you faced: git commit -m "Your comments."
4. Push the project to the github: git push origin master.

More importantly, remember to check your WiKi and finish your assigned task in time. Thanks. shenshaowei.
