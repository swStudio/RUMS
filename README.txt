1. Open the disk or any file directory you wanna pull or clone the project on the github, take an example, open disk e, you can use command cd e: to do that.
2. If you lose the file of our repository, you can clone it anyway: git clone git@github.com:swStudio/RUMS.git RUMS
3. When you finish the task in the wiki, then commit and leave your comments, telling that what you have done and the difficuties you faced: git commit -m "Your comments."
