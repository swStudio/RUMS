Buddies, remember to click this link when you start your work, https://github.com/swStudio/RUMS.
Below are some commands that we use ofen:
1. Open the disk or any file directory you wanna pull or clone the project on the github, take an example, open disk e, you can use command cd e: to do that.
2. If you lose the file of our repository, you can clone it anyway: git clone git@github.com:swStudio/RUMS.git RUMS
3. When you finish the task in the wiki, then commit and leave your comments, telling that what you have done and the difficuties you faced: git commit -m "Your comments."
4. Push the project to the github: git push origin master.

More importantly, remember to check your WiKi and finish your assigned task in time. Thanks. shenshaowei.

A new version of Coding Style Guidelines, with adding something in detailed.

Some notices: With the difficulties we are faced currently in our project, we do not finish this step by the requirement in time. We just code the rough part functions but do not link them in a efficient way. And we do not packet the jar file to create a executable file except a server jar file used for our server client. Anyway, we will finish our job in the week and we will try our best.
